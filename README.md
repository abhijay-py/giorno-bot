Install the dependencies in info/requirements.txt and run the bot.py file to launch the bot. Tweak the botID, programmerID, and logID accordingly, and modify the bot token to a bot token generated through the discord developer portal. Also comment out line 56 of bot.py, which enables the custom functionality cog, which is not published to the github as it contains information about private discord servers. Feel free to reach out if any other issues arise in the operation of the bot.
